Course: Game Graphics and Real-time Rendering

Description: 

- A. Design a 3D scene with 3 objects, each with different shaders. The sphere uses the Phong lighting model shader, along with a texture and vertex displacement shader. The cylinder has a rotational matrix displacement shader and the rectangle has a procedural texture and vertex displacement shader.
- B. Create a fragment shader that takes an image and applies an image processing algorithm to it. The plane shape uses a filter kernel from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)). Mouse movement changes the amount of sharpness on the texture.
- C. Create a multi-color cellular automata. The cube has a cyclic cellular automata rule with 3 states/colors and uses Moore's neighbourhood to check neighbouring cells.
