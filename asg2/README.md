### Assignment 2 - Bloom, Heightmap, and Water Refraction

Created for course CMPM 163 at UC Santa Cruz

**Professor:** Angus Forbes

**Course:** Game Graphics and Real-time Rendering

### Description

- Part A.  Created a 3D scene with a character model which has an outline shader applied to it. The second shader is a screen-space bloom filter that blurs and brightens the scene. Phong lighting model is also used here.
- Part B.  Created an outdoor 3D scene with a cubemap. The quad in the scene uses a height map from a noise function to generate a mountainous terrain. A simple plane of water is added which reflects the sky.
